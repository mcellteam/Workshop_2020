# MCell
## Repository for MCell models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2019 Workshop.

MCell is currently used as the computation engine behind CellBlender. So most of the CellBlender tutorials will be using
MCell implicitly.

However, any MCell-specific tutorials and files should be included in this section.
